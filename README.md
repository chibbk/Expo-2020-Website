# Expo-2020-Website
A high school project of mine made in grade 11 involving a digital world exposition.

The world fair features 5 countries with 1 page each. Each page contains relevant images and a video showcasing the country flag and national anthem. 
The user may switch between pages using a navigation bar. Lastly, the final page displays the exposition's location and allows the user to enter their details in order to book tickets.
